	<h3>Crunching the numbers</h3>
	<p>The decision of which violations to include was somewhat arbitrary. I tried to isolate violations that had the greatest likelihood of being tied to trash stored on residential properties. That meant excluding violation for improper storage of trash on commercial properties, violations involving construction sites, etc. The data I used for 2016 includes variations of the following categories:</p>
	<p><ul>
	<li>'Improper storage trash: res', 'Illegal dumping < 1 cubic yd'</li>
       <li>'Trash illegally dump container',</li>
       <li>'Maint. of Areas Free from Garbage & Rubbish(Common Areas) - In any dwelling, the owner shall be responsible for maintaining in a clean and sanitary condition free of garbage, rubbish, filth all common areas.',
       <li>'Illegal dumping 1-5 cubic yd.:',</li>
       <li>'Storage of Garbage & Rubbish-Owner of dwelling w/ 3 units or more/rooming house shall provide as many receptacles needed for garbage as are sufficient.  before final collection and be located convenient to the occ that no objectionable odors enter any dwelling',</li>
       <li>'Illegal dumping w a vehicle',</li>
       <li>'Maint. of Areas Free from Garbage & Rubbish(Land) - The owner of any parcel of land, vacant or otherwise, shall be responsible for maintaining such parcel of land in a clean and sanitary condition.',</li>
       <li>'Storage of Garbage & Rubbish - Garbage or mixed garbage and rubbish shall be stored in watertight receptacles with tight-fitting covers.  Said receptacles and covers shall be of metal or other durable rodent-proof material ',
